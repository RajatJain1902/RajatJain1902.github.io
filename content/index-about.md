Hey there! Iâ€™m a research scholar at the Mechanical Engineering Department at NIT Warangal, India. Presently, I am actively engaged in a project under the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), RCI (Research Center Imarat), Hyderabad, India. My research involves Laser laser-assisted machining of the nanoparticle-reinforced fused silica-based ceramic composites fabricated through the Gelcasting process for Radome Application. My interests also lie in the development of digital twins for mechanical systems using Microsoft Azure Platform.
When I'm not immersed in my research responsibilities, you'll find me participating in gym workouts (HIITs), exploring diverse destinations, fostering meaningful connections through engaging conversations, exploring the intricacies of history and geopolitics, and tuning in to podcasts like the Hubermann Lab Podcast and Joe Rogan.
